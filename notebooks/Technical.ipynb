    "## 0. Preliminaries and Setup Instructions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"preliminaries\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is primarily intended for the user to be able to replicate the results of this analysis or extend it more comfortably on new data. Below, I outline the steps for: initializing a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, creating a config.py file which is necessary to use the database functionality of the CaBi (Capital Bikeshare) package, using the conda environment provided for the project, and installing the CaBi package for local use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 PostgreSQL / PostGIS <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"postgres\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is not strictly necessary for the scope of this project as it stands, I highly recommend the use of PostgreSQL/PostGIS as an intermediate storage method if the user plans to revisit the data more than once or twice. The geopandas pickling/other traditional file formats are a bit finicky, and this approach has several advantages. First among these is flexibility with respect to the volume of data handled at any one time. A database approach, in contrast to a pandas dataframe for example, allows the user to load a smaller selection of areas to model at one time, while storing the majority of records elsewhere. Geographical data are already a bit larger to traditional datatypes and if the user wishes to observe longer periods of time the number of observations quickly expands into the millions after just a few months of trip history. Next is extensibility; below we work primarily with counts from a modeling perspective, but in addition to new trips information becoming available monthly, there are a number of logical extensions to this method which incorporate for example, weather data, in conjunction with additional features of the dataset not used for this phase of the project.  A database is well-suited to handle joining and automatically updating these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can find the installation instructions for PostgreSQL on their website along with other helpful resources: https://www.postgresql.org/\n",
    "The EDB installer is available for download here: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads\n",
    "For this project we utilize PostGIS to store point geometries for longitude/latitude coordinates. You can install PostGIS as part of the \"Stack Builder\" application distributed with the EDB installer referenced above, or find instructions on their website: https://postgis.net/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "Database schema utilized was a default PostgreSQL database named \"CABI\", which the user can create by using either psql or pgAdmin, and all tables will be generated below directly from python. If it's your first time using postgres/postGIS, you can find a good guide to setting up the database schema here: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/spatialdb/node/1958, but remember to use the name \"CABI.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One serious advantage of the database approach is that it allows the data to be accessed from more than one computer. For this project I only used a single user and a local network access permission scheme, but it could easily be scaled. It is presumed that users for whom it makes sense to distribute data more than locally, and/or set up multiple user permissions are capable of doing so. However, for those more casual users who would like to utilize the local network approach, instructions are available here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional note to the first time user wishing to access the database from their local network, which is poorly addressed in the above documentation: once you have modified the pg_hba.conf file, it is necessary to connect to the PostgreSQL instance and run the following, otherwise the modifications will not be recognized:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT pg_reload_conf()```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Configuring Your Database Connection in CaBi <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"config-files\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a rudimentary method to prevent the user's login credentials from being shared, in order for the CaBi package to work correctly with the database functionality, please do the following *prior to installing the CaBi package.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. After forking and cloning the project locally, create a file named \"config.py\" in cabi/etl\n",
    "    2. In config.py define the function connection_params in the following format, filling in the four parameters with the values you defined in setting up the CABI database above:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    def connection_params():\n",
    "        return 'postgresql://<user>:<password>@<address>:<port>/CABI'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "           \n",
    "       Note, defaults are probably postgres for user, localhost for address, unless you are connecting over a local network, and 5432 for port, unless you have chosen a different one during setup.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3 Conda Environment <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conda-env\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to a bug in statsmodels 0.12 release (which by and large is excellent and contains several useful features which we make use of below) there is a compatibility issue between pmdarima's current release 1.7.1, and statsmodels 0.12. By the time you read this the issue may be resolved, however as of now there is a carefully researched fix included in this repository.  Please note that the following should work and has been tested on Mac OSX and Linux, but there may be some lingering issues for Windows users. In the event that conda is unable to solve the included environment we suggest that you remove the version constraint from statsmodels (pmdarima will want it to be less than 0.12 (opposite of what is specified in the environment file).  This will result in loss of ability to run the sections in modeling on Markov Regime Switching, but as discussed we do not select this as our final model due to the out of sample prediction limitations.  Here are the steps we recommend to recreate the environment for this project. Seasoned conda users may want to reference the discussion thread here, especially the detailed answer given by pmdarima maintainer aaronreidsmith towards the end of the thread: https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima/issues/326 \n",
    "\n",
    "First, try the following from the home directory of this repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda env create -f environment.yaml ``` \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an issue where the above approach \"hangs\" when solving environment, the first recommendation is to update conda with\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda update conda ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if still having an issue with hanging solve, this may take a moment to solve, but should do the trick. Run the following prior to creating the environment to limit the search space (note this should not be necessary for most users):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda config --set channel_priority strict ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is in place, we need to install pmdarima. In order to do that without causing the above-mentioned compatibility issue, we have adapted meta.yaml file as discussed in the github issue referenced above. It is available in the pmdarima directory of this repository. Please feel free to inspect the meta.yaml before installing for details on the work-around. Next, the user will need to run the following from the home directory of this repository. First, if you have not already activated, the new environment, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda activate cabi-env ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the new environment is activated run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda-build pmdarima ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a local channel from which you can install pmdarima. For more details please see: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html\n",
    "\n",
    "If you previously set channel prirority you will next need to reset it with either \"false\" as shown below, or \"flexible\"\n",
    "\n",
    "``` conda config --set channel_priority false ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we install pmdarima with our new local channel. Copy the channel location output from conda-build (should look something like this: /opt/anaconda3/envs/cabi-env/conda-bld/osx-64/pmdarima-1.7.1-py38h1de35cc_0.tar.bz2 ), then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda config --add channels <YOUR-LOCAL-CHANNEL> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "And last, to complete installation run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda install pmdarima```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.4 The CaBi package <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"cabi-package\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper functions used in this project are packaged together as CaBi, which the user can install locally to fully reproduce all steps. After creating the config.py file (important that this be done in order!) navigate to the home directory of the project from the command line and run one of the following commands according to whether or not you're using conda environment.  Both are installed with develop, so that the user can edit the underlying scripts as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "If using conda:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda develop . ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install, and to uninstall:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda develop -u . ```\n",
    "\n",
    "If not using conda (substitute with python3 on systems that differentiate):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python setup.py develop ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install, and to uninstall:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python setup.py develop --uninstall ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Last step in the setup process is to add a kernel for the environment so you can use it inside of Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython kernel install --user --name=cabi-env ``` \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Preparing the Raw Dataframes for Joining\n",
    "\n",
    "First we observe that though the column names are not consistent throughout each monthly set, this appears to be due to a recent change in conventions, and the format is quite consistent in both the data prior to April of 2020, and the data after April of 2020. We define a quick test to confirm this observation, and then do some preliminary cleaning on the older \"legacy\" formatted data first. This process is detailed and explained in cabi.cleaning, and we reproduce the results of the full preparation process below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though we do explore a strategy for imputation of latitude and longitude based on Stations in the legacy data which is quite effective, we didn not end up pursuing this line of analysis and thus do not include this step here for three main reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Though there is some argument for exploring counts/variance in specific geographic areas on a historical basis relative to current levels, this is possible through indirect methods of imputation that do not involve the creation of a costly Point geometry column. In addition, our analysis does not explore spatial correlation except at a generalized areal level, but several researchers have tried this in the past with decent results for slightly different targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The results of our initial EDA reveal a large disruption due to COVID. As discussed below, this leads us to the decision to only use the more recent data, as it is extraordinarily difficult to cross validate further results. To break this down further our data contain what we first intuit, and then show in the modeling section are essentially at least two distinct Markov regimes in even the subset we chose. This number would increase by including the data from pre-COVID months.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From a business perspective, we are answering an operational rather than strategic problem, and are therefore primarily concerned with relatively short time intervals for prediction. Though it would potentially be a fair assumption that there is some larger seasonal effect on perhaps a roughly annual or biannual basis, it seems unlikely that it would contribute significantly enough to our particular question of interest to justify the increased computing power it would necessitate to approximate such a trend at the frequency we look at. It seems far more likely that exploring other exogenous features and modeling approaches would offer significantly more marginal gain, and should be explored prior to pursuing such an approach.\n",
